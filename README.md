=============================

**Welcome to the organizing hub for the NDoCH event that's coming to Sacramento May 31, 2014!**

[National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org) (NDoCH) is a collection of events that will be happening simultaneously across the nation at the end of May. Code for America is one of the organizing partners for this event at the national level. Brigades across the nation will partner with their communities to host events of all kinds. 

Here's what we know about this year's NDoCH in Sacramento so far:

* Code4Sac will organize an NDoCH event in Sacramento for the second year in a row
* Space has been reserved with Hacker Lab >> May 31 - Jun 1 2014
* City of Sacramento really wants to partner with us to make this event great

What's next:

* We need to get a planning team together - C4S people, City staff, local community group leaders, etc
* We need to decide what kind of event we want to have
